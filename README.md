# LabelCorrectionForMultiLabelClassification-Research
Label correction strategy is my own algorithm for fixing unusual prediction results from traditional classfiers. This algorithm can be used both in multi-lable and hierarchical multi-label classification problems. This algorithm showed promising results and significantly increased accuracy in most of datasets.
